## Soviet Arch Database project repo

**SADB** - web project made as structured storage of data about soviet type architecture all across the world *(starting from sochi)*
There will be information about *soviet housebuilding series* and their *specific types* (as example: *series - 1-335AS, type: 1-335-16S*) as well as *the list of specific houses of those series*.
Types will have various info: from building material to specific projecting info, photos and facade pattern.

Also there will be **social part** - account system and forums where people can discuss specific series and houses.
